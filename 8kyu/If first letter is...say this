/*
 Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!

The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:

name + " plays banjo" 
name + " does not play banjo"
Names given are always valid strings.

*/


// Answer #1

function areYouPlayingBanjo(name) {
  return name + (name[0].toLowerCase() == 'r' ? ' plays' : ' does not play') + " banjo";
}

//Answer #2


function areYouPlayingBanjo(name) {
  if (name[0] == 'R' || name[0] == 'r')
    return name + " plays banjo";
  else
    return name + " does not play banjo";
}

//Answer #3
   
   
   if (name.charAt(0).toLowerCase() === 'r') {
        return name + " plays banjo";
    } else {
        return name + " does not play banjo";
    }

// the .charAt() method in JavaScript is used to retrieve a specific character from a string based on its index position.
